summary: "PyDeltaRCM is the Python version of DeltaRCM by Man Liang. DeltaRCM
  is a parcel-based cellular flux routing and sediment transport model for the
  formation of river deltas, which belongs to the broad category of rules-based
  exploratory models. The model has the ability to resolve emergent channel
  behaviors including channel bifurcation, avulsion, and lateral migration. Sediment
  transport distinguishes two types of sediment: sand and mud, which have
  different transport and deposition/erosion rules. Stratigraphy is recorded as
  the sand fraction in layers. Best usage of DeltaRCM is the investigation of
  autogenic processes in response to external forcings."
